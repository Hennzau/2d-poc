# 2d-poc with bevy

## Installation

I recommend using [just](https://github.com/casey/just).

```bash
just install-ubuntu # will install all required dependencies for bevy as well as dependencies for fast compile times
just rustup # will install rustup components required for this project
```

You will need to get [Cute Fantasy Free](https://kenmi-art.itch.io/cute-fantasy-rpg) assets. You can download them from the website, without any
account required. Extract the zip file and place the content in the assets folder under the name 'Cute_Fantasy_Free'.

## Usage

### Running the project in debug mode

```bash
just run
```

### Running the project in release mode

```bash
just release
```
