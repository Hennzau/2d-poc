# Sprint The Game: The Rust remake

I recommend using [just](https://github.com/casey/just).

```bash
just install-ubuntu # will install all required dependencies for bevy as well as dependencies for fast compile times
just rustup # will install rustup components required for this project
git lfs pull
```

## Usage

### Running the game in debug mode

```bash
just run
```

### Running the game in release mode

```bash
just release
```
